//! `goal`: the decision model drives the current view toward a short task — observe, one
//! decision request, one action, repeat, bounded.
//!
//! It never decides success. It stops on DONE or BLOCKED, an unreadable answer, a failed action,
//! the step cap, or the same action again where it gains nothing (no visible change, or a value
//! typed again into the field it was just typed into), and returns the trace and the
//! final view: the caller reads the view and judges.
