//! The window's three states on macOS as pure logic: events in, what to do
//! out. Hidden while no tab is open; the mini, a small floating preview, whenever one is; the
//! expanded window, which only the person's click opens. The agent's acts spin the mini and
//! refresh its picture, its `show` blinks it, and nothing it does expands anything. Where there
//! is no mini ([`Support::WindowOnly`]) the window opens as an ordinary one. The AppKit side
//! (host_presence.rs) applies what this decides; the timings come in as values.
