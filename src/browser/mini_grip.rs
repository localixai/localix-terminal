//! The mini's grip (macOS): a native view over its page that takes the
//! person's press itself, as openclaw's and DmNote's frameless windows do. A press that moves is
//! handed, with the press itself, to AppKit's own window drag (smooth, snapping, ended by the
//! release wherever it happens); one that does not is a click, and expands the window. The page
//! never sees either: an image there dragged itself out as a file, and a release outside it was
//! missed. Only the page's expand button, in the corner, is left to the page.
